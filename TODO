1. Geometry only loads GeometryMesh, make it work with curves, scatterers, volumes and instances.
2. Need a way to load in materials.
3. Dirtying scene graph for editing.
4. Remove limitations on number of geometry mesh attributes.
5. Volume integrator.
6. Crashing when switching between Delegates.
7. Probably some memory leak somewhere, check for it.
8. Samples aov and doing aov finalization on the GPU.
